# danteweather v0.1A
What would Dante have said about the weather today?  
The service retrieves IP geolocation data, a weather report and matches with quotes from Divina Comedia. Because why not?

## Usage
Use dantewrite.go to (manually) build a database, then danteserv.go to run the web service. That's all.

# Where is the service running?
The application is in an early alpha state; unstable and not really useful. Hence there are only temporary instances set up for specific tests. This will change once the database has been populated.
